# README

This is a work in progress proof of concept ruby/rails form builder runner with node frontend

Building against

- `fb-ioj` on `rails` branch https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-ioj/tree/rails
- `fb-components-core` on `rails` branch https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fb-components-core/tree/rails

I don't know how to develop against npm packages locally and simply symlinked to get around this
